## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to analyze a dataset containing students' scores and other related data to identify key trends, insights, and factors that contribute to performance. The analysis involves data preprocessing, exploration, and visualization to understand relationships within the data.

## Dataset
data = pd.read_csv('student_scores.csv')
data.head()

The dataset, `student_scores.csv`, contains the following columns:
- **Student ID**: Unique identifier for each student
- **Subject**: Name of the subject
- **Score**: Score obtained by the student
- **Class**: Class level of the student
- **Age**: Age of the student
- **Gender**: Gender of the student

The dataset helps in understanding patterns and factors related to students' performance across different subjects, ages, and classes.

## Data Analysis
The analysis consists of:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Addressing missing values, handling outliers, and formatting data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing score distributions, class performance, and gender-based performance differences.
3. **Trend Analysis**: Identifying correlations and patterns between students' attributes and their performance.
4. **Visualization**: Creating visualizations to illustrate performance trends across subjects and demographic groups.

## Results and Insights
- Insights into performance trends across subjects.
- Analysis of gender and age factors in relation to scores.
- Identification of areas where students perform better or may need additional support.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language for analysis.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Numpy**: Numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Google Colab**: Development platform.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mubin755555/students-result-analysis.git
## Step 2: Data Cleaning
Describe the process of handling missing values, filtering outliers, and adjusting data formats.

## Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Distribution of Scores: Plot histograms or boxplots for score distributions.
sns.histplot(data['Score'], bins=10)
plt.title('Score Distribution')
plt.show()
## Class and Subject Analysis: Analyze performance across classes and subjects.

## Step 4: Visualization of Trends
Include visualizations that compare performance by age, gender, etc.
Add Screenshots of each visualization with brief explanations.
## Step 5: Conclusions and Insights
Summarize findings and highlight key insights.
